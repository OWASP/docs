# Infrastructure

We are documenting our infrastructure here for four essential reasons:

1. It speeds up debugging and helps with disaster recovery.

2. It enables cleaner and more efficient knowledge transfer between present and future staff members.

3. Transparency around our infrastructure configuration will enable our community to audit our security without needing privileged access.

4. Practices and patterns we use that work well can be adopted and replicated by others.
