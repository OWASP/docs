# OWASP Documentation Library

This is the official library of documentation for the OWASP Foundation,
including our handbooks.

Documentation for individual projects is _not_ hosted in this repository.

## Tech Stack

Documentation files are under `source/`, and are written primarily in
[Markedly Structured Text (MyST)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),
a variant of Markdown (`.md`). Some files may be in RestructuredText (`.rst`)
instead, although we recommend MyST for consistency.

The theme is the sphinx-rtd-theme, with some modifications via
`source/_static/theme.css`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome as Pull Requests. However, they must be approved
by a member of the OWASP Foundation staff before they can be merged.
